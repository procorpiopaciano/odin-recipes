    <p>
        Kare Kare is a traditional Filipino stew complimented with a thick savory peanut sauce. The commonly used meats for this dish are ox tail, tripe, and pork leg; on some occasions goat and chicken meat are also used. Besides the peanuts, this dish depends on the shrimp paste (on the side) in order to be fully enjoyed. Traditionally, "palayok" (clay cooking pot) is used to cook this dish and it is also used as the serving pot.

        Steps

    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring oxtails and water to a boil in a large pot. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, at least 2 hours, adding more water as necessary. Skim as much fat from the top of the liquid as possible.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer oxtails to a plate. Crumble beef bouillon cubes into the pot and stir to dissolve. Add bok choy, beans, and eggplant and simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the vegetables are simmering, heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in achiote powder. Stir in peanut butter until melted. Add about 1/2 of the simmering broth and simmer for 5 minutes. Add oxtails and cook for 5 minutes. Transfer remaining broth and vegetables to the pot and stir to combine. Serve hot.
