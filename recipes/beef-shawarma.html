    <h1>Beef Shawarma</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>
        This famous Middle Eastern street food is basically heavily-marinated meat (or chicken), layered on a vertical rotisserie or spit where it is slow-roasted for days until perfectly tender and extra flavorful! To serve it, thin layers of meat are shaved off the spit and piled up into a warm pita pocket with heaps of fresh toppings and a good drizzle of tahini sauce.
    </p>
    <p>
        You do not need a special rotisserie or spit to make it at home. In this easy homemade shawarma recipe, you just need a large skillet or cast iron grill pan. And to make sure we get as close as possible to the texture and authentic flavor of beef shawarma, slice up your meat very thinly and toss it in the tantalizing shawarma seasoning with a bit of garlic, onions, lemon juice and olive oil.

        </li>
